In our SLAAC example, we demonstrate how PC0 and PC1
autoconfigure their IPv6 address using the prefix provided by
router R01, and their own mac address using EUI-64.

!SLAAC configuration on the router:
en
debug ipv6 nd
conf t
hostname R01
no ip domain lookup
interface g0/0
ipv6 address 2001:DB8:10::1/64
no shut
exit
ipv6 unicast-routing
exit

In our SLAAC with DHCPv6 (Stateless DHCPv6) example, we demonstrate 
how PC0 and PC1 autoconfigure their 
IPv6 address using the prefix provided 
by router R01, and their own mac address using EUI-64.  These hosts also learn 
the address of the DNS server from the partial DHCP server configuration.

interface g0/0

exit

Stateful DHCPv6 does not require SLAAC.
It is important to note that although DHCPv6 
provides a service similar to DHCPv4, the two
protocols are different.

One indication of this difference in the UDP ports on which DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 operate.
With DHCPv4, client machines listen on port 68 and DHCPv4 servers listen on port 67.

With DHCPv6, client machines listen on port 546 and DHCPv4 servers listen on port 547.

From netacad Switching Routing Wireless Essentials, Version 7.0, we read:

The steps for DHCPv6 operations are as follows:

The host sends an RS message.
The router responds with an RA message.
The host sends a DHCPv6 SOLICIT message.
The DHCPv6 server responds with an ADVERTISE message.
The host responds to the DHCPv6 server.
The DHCPv6 server sends a REPLY message.
