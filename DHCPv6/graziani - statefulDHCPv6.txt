https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzoeuXqvmG0  Rick Graziani - IPv6 Stateful DHCPv6

note - the   < > no-autoconfig  does not work in packet tracer

found reference to the a-flag in one of Rick Graziani's video.  Good video!

The only problem is the following interface configuration command is not recognized in packet tracer:

ipv6  nd prefix 2001:db8:10::/64 no-autoconfig
