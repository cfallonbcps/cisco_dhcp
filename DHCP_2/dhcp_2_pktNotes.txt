DHCP_2

This network demonstrates the following six networking concepts:
1.  Configuration and use of DHCPv4 in a multiple vlan environment where one router provides
DHCP service to two vlans.
2 .  Inter-vlan routing
3.   Static routing
4.   Use of the default static route  0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0   to define a gateway of last resort
5.   Use of a local DNS server
6.   Network Address Translation / Port Address Translation   and    Static Network Address Translation
7.   Access to a server in the DMZ area


Five Questions:

1.  Why must S0 port fa0/24 be configured as a trunk?
2.  What is the purpose of the static route configured on R0?
3.  What is the purpose of each static route configured on edge? 
4.  How would this network change if the DHCP server were located between R0 and edge?
5.  Why does the ISP need no static routing?   (i.e.   R0 would not provide DHCP service
